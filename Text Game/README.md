# Text Game

A text-based adventure game project I worked on in my senior year of high school during an independent studies programming class. The bulk of what I worked on was the main engine for parsing the commands, but also wrote some code for interactable objects.  
  
When I first wrote this, my knowledge of Java and programming conventions, utilities, libraries, etc. was pretty limited. Up to that point, I had only ever done programming in Java, so it made the most sense for me to use it here. For the most part, I avoided looking up code online and wrote everything from scratch, using only some basic data structures and object-oriented programming.  
  
Ultimately, the project was never finished because of roadblocks that arose in the main engine/parser. When work slowed down, I had to move on to another project in order to present some results that could be used as my grade for the class.  
  
However, I remember enjoying working on this project quite a lot, spending many class periods writing code in notebooks to try to improve the engine and make it easier to build on. So, I decided to put it up here for the sake of posterity, and to preserve the original files in case they ever get lost.

It's been several years since I've seen or touched this code, so I likely don't remember much of what I wrote or how it was supposed to work. I may decide to go through it and add some comments at some point, but for now I will just leave the files as they are.
