# RPGVX Scripts

These are some old scripts I had written for use in RPG Maker VX for a quest log system. They were written during my independent studies course in my senior year of high school. There were other projects I did in RPG Maker VX as well during the class, but they are on my old laptop. I will likely add those files here the next time I can get my laptop.
