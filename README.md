## Project List

### CPS 350 Midterm Project
The midterm project for my CPS 350 - Operating Systems class. A simulator for managing processes and events on a CPU.

### Text Game
A text game project that I started in my senior year of high school during an independent study programming course. My knowledge of Java and programming conventions/utilities at this time was still fairly limited, so it is a bit primitive, but I was very focused on it at the time and excited at the prospect of creating my own text-based adventure game. The project was not finished because of roadblocks and the need to move on to other work in order to have some gradeable results for the course. The project is being kept here for posterity, and to preserve the original files.
